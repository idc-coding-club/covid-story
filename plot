The clock struck 11pm when a certain Dr. Chang Li was rushing towards his office. 
Her genomics lab at the prestigous Wuhan institute of virology had a faulty electrical connection which tripped the main connection of the lab from the building. 
In this darkness, he started panicking, given he was a claustrophobic. 

He got a call from the authorities that it was not the faulty connection, but something else. Something was conspiring. 

It was the NSA!
